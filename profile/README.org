* About
The "emacs-magus" organization hosts Emacs init.el configuration utility packages.  The packages here are meant in part to replace [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]] with smaller, more focused packages, but some also provide novel functionality.

* Replacing Unpackaged Doom Emacs Functionality
Doom has a lot of useful functionality that is unfortunately not available to non-Doom users without copying code.

Here are packages that replace previously unpackaged Doom functionality:
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/familiar][familiar]] - An alternative to general.el and ~map!~ (~map!~ is built on general.el)
- [[https://github.com/ajgrf/on.el][on.el]] - Provides hooks added by Doom like =on-switch-buffer-hook=, =on-switch-window-hook=, and =on-switch-frame-hook=
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/satch.el][satch.el]] - Provides setting, hook, and advice helpers (including transient hooks and advice like found in Doom)
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/once][once]] - Provides alternatives to Doom's =:after-call=, =:defer-incrementally=, ~defer-until!~, etc. for delaying loading (or configuring) packages until some condition is met
- [[https://gitlab.com/jjzmajic/handle][handle]] - Allows having a single command to do things like start a repl, evaluate code, pull up documentation, etc.; you run ~handle~ to associate the correct functions with each feature for a major mode
- templates - There is [[https://github.com/mineo/yatemplate][yatemplate]], but it unfortunately does not currently support a lot of the things Doom's template system does (e.g. complex conditional activation)

There are also the obvious packages that like [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] and [[https://github.com/doomemacs/themes][doom-themes]].

* Replacing General.el
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/familiar][familiar]] - Replaces general.el key definers
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/imp][imp]] - Evil support for familiar
  - leto.el - "Instructor" to generate a minimal/readable expansion of familiar forms, so you can see what code they will run
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/arcana][arcana]] - Replaces general.el key definition helpers (~general-key~, ~general-simulate-key~, ~general-key-dispatch~, ~general-predicate-dispatch~, etc.)
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/satch.el][satch.el]] - Replaces general.el non-keybinding configuration utilities (setting, hook, and advice helpers)
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/once][once]] - Replaces general.el's deferred evaluation utilities (which were mostly placeholders or unimplemented)
- ? - Replaces general-override-mode

* Other
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/foundation][foundation]] - My personal setup.el keywords that are not found in other packages (like satch.el and familiar)
- [[https://github.com/emacs-magus/quicken][quicken]] - "Hacks" to speed up Emacs initialization (meant more to be a template for early-init files and provide potentially useful code to copy into your configuration; will likely never be part of a package archive)
